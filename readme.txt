Stable tag: trunk

Allow the use of OpenID for authentication of users and commenters.


== Description ==

OpenID is an [open standard][] that lets you sign in to other sites on the Web
using little more than your blog URL. This means less usernames and passwords
to remember and less time spent signing up for new sites.  This plugin allows
verified OpenIDs to be linked to existing user accounts for use as an
alternative means of authentication.  Additionally, commenters may use their
OpenID to assure their identity as the author of the comment and provide a
framework for future OpenID-based services (reputation and trust, for
example).

This plugin was started as a port of Alan Castonguay's [wpopenid][] plugin, and
has since added a number of significant features and bug-fixes to the excellent
foundation Alan provided.
